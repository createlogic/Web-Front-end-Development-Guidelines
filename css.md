CSS
=========

The start-up boilerplate provides the following files:

- reset.css
- base.css
- normalize.css
- main.css

##reset.css
This consist of general resets to help browsers render elements to their initial defaults. This is taken from [Eric Meyer's](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) `reset.css` with some elements moved in and out to other files for consistency and modularity.
