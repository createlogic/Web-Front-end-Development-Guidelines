CSS
=========

This section provides information on the CSS files provided with the boilerplate along with guidelines that are required to follow for a more scalable modular architecture as per [Jonathan Snook's](http://snook.ca/) [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) book.

The **CSS coding guidelines** can be found [here](css_guidelines.md).


The **start-up boilerplate** provides the following files:

- reset_normalize.css
- base.css
- media.css
- main.css

###reset_normalize.css
This is a combination of general resets from [Eric Meyer's](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) `reset.css` to help browsers render elements to their initial defaults and a trimmed version of [Nicholas Gallagher's](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) `normalize.css`, from which I have reset some of the normalized elements which made more sense for most of my projects.

###base.css
