Coding Standards & Guidelines
=========
The section would drill deep into best practices on `HTML`, `CSS` & `JavaScript` separately. It would also cover code linting and validating HTML, CSS & JavaScript using [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/). There is an easy to follow [guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) to install Grunt & associated contributed modules using Node.js package manager. 


#Separation of Concerns 
Separation of Content (Markup), Presentation (CSS) & Behavior (JavaScript) should be imposed there should not be any overlapping of any of the three technologies at any point of time into each otherâ€™s layer.

So no CSS code should be mixed in HTML neither any JavaScript code should be written inside HTML layer. Each should sit in its own layer with loosely coupled selector based linking.

**Using templating engine**
If there is a requirement of mixing JavaScript with Content(Markup). It is highly advisable and recommended to using semantic templating using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) or 
[Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/).

This section is divided into the following sections:
